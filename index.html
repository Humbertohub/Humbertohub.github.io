<p>Self-care has been defined as <strong><em>"a multidimensional, multifaceted process</em></strong> of purposeful <strong><em>engagement</em></strong> in strategies that <strong><em>promote</em></strong> healthy <strong><em>functioning</em></strong> and enhance <strong><em>well-being"</em></strong>. Essentially, it describes a <strong><em>conscious act</em></strong> a person takes in order to <strong><em>promote</em></strong> their own <strong><em>physical, mental,</em></strong> and <strong><em>emotional health</em></strong>. When individuals <strong><em>look after their own health</em></strong> they use the <strong><em>knowledge</em></strong> and <strong><em>information available</em></strong> to them. Therefore, it is a <strong><em>decision-making process</em></strong> that <strong><em>empowers individuals</em></strong> to look after their own health efficiently and conveniently, in <strong><em>collaboration with</em></strong> health and social <strong><em>care professionals</em></strong> as needed.</p>
      
<p>There are actually many forms of self-care (seven to be exact) that you should embrace in order to feel best in all areas of life:</p>

      <p>Physical self-care includes how you're <strong><em>fueling your body</em></strong>, how much <strong><em>sleep</em></strong> you're getting, how much <strong><em>physical activity</em></strong> you are doing, and how well you're <strong><em>caring</em></strong> for your <strong><em>physical needs</em></strong>.

      <p>A lifestyle including <strong><em>religion</strong></em> or <strong><em>spirituality</strong></em> is generally a <strong><em>healthier</strong></em> lifestyle.

Nurturing your spirit, however, doesn't have to involve religion. It can involve <strong><em>anything</strong></em> that helps you <strong><em>develop</strong></em> a deeper <strong><em>sense of meaning</strong></em>, <strong><em>understanding</strong></em>, or <strong><em>connection</strong></em> with the universe.

Whether you enjoy <strong><em>meditation</strong></em>, attending a <strong><em>religious service</strong></em>, or <strong><em>praying</strong></em>, spiritual self-care is important.</p><br>
      
  <p class="tips-to-consider">Keep these points in mind as you practice self-care for your spiritual health:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Practise activities like 
          Yoga or Meditation
         <li>Try mindful walking 
         <li>Connect with like-minded
           individuals 
          
        </li>
        
      </ul>

      <p><strong><em>Socialization is key</strong></em> to self-care. But, often, it's hard to make time for friends and it's easy to neglect your relationships when life gets busy.

<strong><em>Close connections</strong></em> are important to your well-being. The best way to cultivate and maintain close relationships is to <strong><em>put time</strong></em> and <strong><em>energy</strong></em> into <strong><em>building</strong></em> your <strong><em>relationships</strong></em> with others.


There isn't a certain number of hours you should devote to your friends or work on your relationships. Everyone has slightly different social needs. The <strong><em>key</strong></em> is to <strong><em>figure out what your social needs are</strong></em> and to <strong><em>build enough time</strong></em> in your schedule to create an optimal social life.</p><br>
      
    <p class="tips-to-consider">Think about these elements as you take care of your social self:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Find balance between between
          time for personal self-care and
          social interactions 
         <li>Practise reaching out to
           others 
         <li>Focus on quality time 
          
        </li>
        
      </ul>

      <p>Financial self-care is about <strong><em>taking care</strong></em> of <strong><em>your money</strong></em>. But just like other forms of self-care, it’s also about <strong><em>keeping up the momentum</strong></em> as much as it is about doing what’s good for you. Essentially, when you have financial self-care, you find the <strong><em>best way to manage your finances</strong></em> and <strong><em>improve</strong></em> your <strong><em>financial situation</strong></em>. This may not sound fun, but worrying about debt, paying the bills, and falling short of savings goals can all lead to a lot of stress that can be draining both physically and mentally. Self-care and money can go hand in hand.</p><br>
      
   <p class="tips-to-consider">Reflect on these ideas as you prioritize your financial self-care:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Notice your spending habits 
         <li>Be aware of your emotions
           when it comes to money
         <li>Establish healthier money
           habits 
          
        </li>
        
      </ul>

      <p>Professional self-care means using <strong><em>habits, processes, systems,</strong></em> and </strong></em>communities</strong></em> to make your <strong><em>work life sustainable</strong></em>. It's usually a lot of <strong><em>debriefing</em></strong> yourself after crises and creating battle plans for later. It's an <strong><em>ever-evolving</em></strong> part of creating <strong><em>work-life balance</em></strong> and <strong><em>boundaries</em></strong>. Perception of work as <strong><em>meaningful</em></strong> is based on your own feeling of value and usefulness of your job, according to your own standards. Doing <strong><em>something</em></strong> <strong><em>significant</em></strong> to others and <strong><em>meaningful</em></strong> to yourself is linked with better mental health and well-being.</p><br>

  <p class="tips-to-consider">Take these factors into account as you focus on your professional well-being:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Look for self-actualisation 
         <li>Try to find a good balance
           between working for others and
           working for yourself
         <li>During your regular work
           routine, try finding new ways
           how to help others
          
        </li>
        
      </ul>

<p>It's important to have healthy coping skills to <strong><em>deal with</em></strong> <strong><em>uncomfortable emotions</em></strong>, like anger, anxiety, and sadness. Emotional self-care may include activities that help you <strong><em>acknowledge</em></strong> and <strong><em>express</em></strong> your <strong><em>feelings</em></strong> regularly and safely.

Whether you talk to a partner or close friend about how you feel, or you set aside time for leisure activities that help you process your emotions, it's <strong><em>important</em></strong> to <strong><em>incorporate</em></strong> <strong><em>emotional self-care</em></strong> into your life. </p><br>

  <p class="tips-to-consider">Here are some aspects to be aware of when you consider about your emotional self-care:</p>

     <ul>
       
        <li>Experience your emotions 
          without judgment, guilt, or
          embarrassment 
         <li>Give yourself the grace to 
           try again when moments don’t 
           go as planned
         <li>Create boundaries that feel 
           good to set and encourage 
           others to do the same
          
        </li>
        
      </ul>
